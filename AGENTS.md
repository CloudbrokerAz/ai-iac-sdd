# AI-Assisted Terraform Module Development (SDD)

AI-assisted development of enterprise-ready Terraform modules via spec-driven development. One design document replaces five artifacts. Tests before code. Security embedded in every phase.

## Core Principles

1. **Security-First**: All decisions prioritize security. No workarounds for security requirements. Constitution MUST rules are non-negotiable.
2. **Module-First**: Author well-structured modules using raw resources with secure defaults. Follow standard module structure (`examples/`, `tests/`, `modules/`).
3. **Single-Artifact Design**: Requirements flow into one `design.md` that replaces spec, plan, contracts, data model, and tasks. One source of truth eliminates cross-artifact contradictions.
4. **MCP-First**: Use MCP tools for AWS documentation and provider docs before general knowledge. Research resource behavior before writing code.
5. **TDD-First**: Tests before code. Write `.tftest.hcl` files from design scenarios, then implement the module to pass them. All tests green = implementation complete.
6. **Parallel Where Safe**: Independent tasks run concurrently. MCP-dependent tasks run sequentially.
7. **Quality Gates**: CRITICAL findings block progression. Reviews use evidence-based findings with citations.

## Workflow

See `tf-plan` SKILL.md (`.claude/skills/tf-plan.md`) for the full 4-phase workflow: Understand, Design, Build+Test, Validate. See `tf-research-heuristics` skill for MCP tool priority and research strategies.

## Directory Layout

See constitution Section 3.2 (`.foundations/memory/constitution.md`) for the canonical file organization rules and directory map.

## Agent Architecture

Agents are subagents dispatched by orchestrator skills. Each agent has a single responsibility. Most agents read inputs from disk and write outputs to disk; research agents return findings in-memory to the orchestrator.

| Agent              | Model  | Purpose                                                             | Input                                                        | Output                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sdd-design`       | opus   | Produce design.md from clarified requirements and research findings | Requirements + research + constitution + template            | `specs/{FEATURE}/design.md`                                 |
| `sdd-research`     | opus   | Answer one specific research question using MCP tools               | Feature path + research question                             | Research findings (returned to orchestrator, not persisted) |
| `tf-test-writer`   | sonnet | Convert design.md test scenarios into `.tftest.hcl` files           | `specs/{FEATURE}/design.md` Section 5                        | `tests/*.tftest.hcl`                                        |
| `tf-task-executor` | opus   | Implement one checklist item from design.md                         | `specs/{FEATURE}/design.md` + checklist item + existing code | Modified `.tf` files                                        |

## Skill Architecture

Skills provide domain knowledge and orchestration logic. They are loaded into agent context as needed.

## Prerequisites

See constitution Section 2 (`.foundations/memory/constitution.md`) for environment prerequisites (CLI tools, tokens, MCP servers).

## Testing Strategy

See constitution Section 6.3 (`.foundations/memory/constitution.md`) for TDD rules and test file conventions. See `tf-implement` skill for the test-first implementation workflow.

## Operational Notes

### GitHub Enterprise Authentication

For GHE repositories:

- **Authentication**: `gh auth login --hostname <hostname>` is required. Standard `gh auth login` only authenticates against github.com.
- **Operations**: Most `gh` commands (issue, pr, repo, etc.) do NOT accept `--hostname` flag. Use `GH_HOST` environment variable instead:
  ```bash
  export GH_HOST=github.enterprise.com
  gh issue create --title "Bug report"
  # Or inline:
  GH_HOST=github.enterprise.com gh pr create --title "Feature"
  ```

### Agent Output Persistence

Most agents have the Write tool and persist their own output artifacts to disk. The orchestrator verifies that expected output files exist after each agent dispatch. **Exception**: Research agents return findings in-memory (~500 tokens each) — the orchestrator collects these and passes them to the design agent via `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Context Management

1. **NEVER call TaskOutput** to read subagent results — EXCEPT for research agents, whose findings (~500 tokens each) are collected and forwarded to the design agent. All other agents write artifacts to disk.
2. **Verify file existence with Glob** after each agent completes -- do NOT read file contents into the orchestrator.
3. **Downstream agents read their own inputs from disk.** The orchestrator passes the FEATURE path plus scope via `$ARGUMENTS`. For the design agent, `$ARGUMENTS` also includes research findings collected from research agents.
4. **Research agents: parallel foreground Task calls** (NOT `run_in_background`). Launch ALL research agents in a single message with multiple Task tool calls, then collect their in-memory findings to pass to the design agent.
5. **Minimal $ARGUMENTS**: Only pass the FEATURE path + a specific question or scope. The one exception is research findings passed to the design agent (~2000 tokens total for 4 research agents).

**Remember**: Always verify with MCP tools. Security is non-negotiable.
